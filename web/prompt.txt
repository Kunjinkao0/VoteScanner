node.js + express server + sqlite:
I need to create an express server, including 4 of the db tables in sqlite, user can setup projects, and can vote for each project. Each record of vote will be saved into vote_record and create vote relatioship row. But vote system is not always able to vote, we also needs a currentPid to indicate which project is voting.
DB schemas here:
- project: id=UUID, name=TEXT, desc=TEXT, cover=TEXT
- vote_record: id=UUID, time=date, device_id=TEXT, score=INT
- project_vote_relationship: pid=foreign key of project id, vid=foreign key of vote_record id
- trusted_device: id=TEXT
For db files:
- create a "_init.js" for initializing database, it's a standalone file for DB reset, not for express db connection
- create a "db.js" file to create db connection and usages, will be used in routers, expose promisified function to query and modify data

app.js is for entrance js file, port=4399, following below rules:
  1. should contains json parser and all following routers, all routers should start with "/api"
  2. should print all of the "device" and "project" in app start callback function
App should integrated with express router with 3 files, all api should firstly considered to be restful; routers should be placed in router folder.
- project.js: including all the prjects CRUD
  - note: as sqlite doesn't supports UUID type, when a new project created, you should call a lib with uuid() to generate uuid
- device.js: including all the devices CRUD
- vote.js:
  - POST "/start": 1 parameter "pid", save it in "app.global.currentPid"
  - POST "/stop": 1 parameter "pid", set "app.global.currentPid" to null
  - POST "/vote": 2 parameters from body, deviceId and projectId, logic:
    1. need to check if deviceId is in "device" table, if not returns 400 - not trusted device
      - note: 1 exception here is if "deviceId" starts with "admin" ignore it
    2. set a variable `const currentPid="projectId || app.global.currentPid"`
      - check in "project" table, if not returns 400 - start a vote first
    3. insert a new row to record and relationship, to save this record and which project it belongs to, score by default is 1, but when deviceId="admin-pop", it should be -2
      -note: using uuid to create id in vote_record
  - GET "/vote-count": "projectId" is a partial parameter
    1. If "projectId" is empty, get all "name" from "project" table, if not return a 1 item array
    2. Get all of the rows are there in relationship table, and summarize each record's score column, and give a total count
    3. Combine project(s) with [{"name": project_name, count: total_count}]

NOTE: **YOU NEED TO GIVE ME ALL OF THE CODE DETAILS**
